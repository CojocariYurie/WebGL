Here are my projects which I implemented for Computer Graphics at the University of Iceland, spring 2014.

Most of the examples can be found live at webgl.mpg.is

The files in Common and Common7e are from Edward Angel, with some modifications.

His book, Interactive Computer Graphics, was used in the course.

More information on the book can be found at:
